## Contributing

If you want to propose a name for a KR Suite Tool, You'll need to follow these rules:

- The tool's name has to be self-explanatory; for example, the tool name *KR Zenith* does not work unless it is a tool for managing zeniths or something else also named Zenith.
    - Good examples: *KR Encrypt*, *KR Audio*, *KR TV*
    - Bad examples: *KR Zenith*, *KR Vanilla*

- The tool must not do something that another KR tool already does, however it is acceptable if the purpose of the proposed tool is different enough from that of the other tool.
- The idea for the tool must be something that can be done in a Linux terminal with no window manager.

| Pre-Alpha | Development of the tool has just begun; it isn't usable for productional of recreational purposes yet. |
| Alpha | The tool has been developed enough so that it is usable for recreational purposes, however it is too incomplete for productional purposes.  |

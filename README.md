The KR Suite is an ambitious collection of infinitely scalable command-line tools written in C.

## Tools list
This is the list of all the tools that have yet been designed.

## Contributing

If you want to propose a name for a KR Suite Tool, You'll need to follow these rules:

- The tool's name has to be self-explainatory; for example, the tool name *KR Zenith* does not work unless it is a tool for managing zeniths or something else also named Zenith.
    - Good examples: *KR Encrypt*, *KR Audio*, *KR TV*
    - Bad examples: *KR Zenith*, *KR Vanilla*

- The tool must not do something that another KR tool already does, however it is acceptable if the purpose of the proposed tool is different enough from that of the other tool.
- The idea for the tool must be something that can be done in a Linux terminal with no window manager.

## Development stages

| Stage | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Idea | No code has been written for the tool yet; only the basic concept exists. |
| Pre-Alpha | Development of the tool has just begun; it isn't usable for productional of recreational purposes yet. |
| Alpha | The tool has been developed enough so that it is usable for recreational purposes, however it is too incomplete for productional purposes.  |
| Beta | The tool can be used for all purposes, but it is not complete yet. |
| Full-Release | The tool is complete. |
